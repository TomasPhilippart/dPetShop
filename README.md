# dPetShop
Dencentralized PetShop built on top of Ethereum blockchain with Truffle.

> :warning: **Note**: You probably won't be able to run this dApp since it was made for personal testing. To develop your own, visit the [tutorial](https://www.trufflesuite.com/tutorials/pet-shop) by Truffle.


## Requirements: 
- Node.js v8+ LTS and npm (comes with Node)
- Git 
- Ganache, a personal blockchain for Ethereum development you can use to deploy contracts, develop applications, and run tests. You can download Ganache by navigating to http://truffleframework.com/ganache and clicking the "Download" button.
- MetaMask (to create and operate your custom RPC)
